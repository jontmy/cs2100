## Computer Organization ##

> The objective of this module is to familiarise students with the fundamentals of computing devices.<br><br>Through this module students will understand the basics of data representation, and how the various parts of a computer work, separately and with each other.<br><br>This allows students to understand the issues in computing devices, and how these issues affect the implementation of solutions.<br><br>Topics covered include data representation systems, combinational and sequential circuit design techniques, assembly language, processor execution cycles, pipelining, memory hierarchy and input/output systems.
